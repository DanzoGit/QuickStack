# QuickStack

For more details about this mod, please refer to the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/1357).

## Build

Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio (using 2022, haven't tested with 2019)
- .NET Framework 4.8

1. Go to your Mods folder. Usually located in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods"
2. Open git bash and run: git clone git@github.com:Westwud1/QuickStack.git
3. This repository also includes the .dll file, so the mod is technically installed and you should be able to use it. The other files (visual studio settings or build files) do not affect the mod.
4. Open QuickStack.sln and you should be good to go.
5. Build the solution. Every path and reference is relative, you shouldn't have any problems.
6. Run the game, either from visual studio, or manually launching the game.
